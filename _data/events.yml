    WorkflowHub was one of the working clusters at the [BCC2020 CollaborationFest](https://bcc2020.github.io/cofest/) as part of [Bioinformatics Community Conference 2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/).


    Activities included a _Bring your own Workflow_ session to register more workflows at https://workflowhub.eu/.


    _Improving support for Galaxy workflows_ worked closely with Galaxy developers at BCC and the topic _Exporting RO-Crate/BioCompute-Object packaged workflows from Galaxy_ which made a first release of the [RO-Crate Python library](https://pypi.org/project/rocrate/) and alignments with [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/).


    _Metadata and BioSchemas_ aligned and released [BioSchemas ComputationalWorkflow profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/0.5-DRAFT-2020_07_21) 0.5 which was also aligned with the next version of [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/).


    _IWC for Galaxy Workflows_ looked at API for workflow registration and created an open source license drop-down list for workflows.

    WorkflowHub was one of the topics at the [Virtual COVID-19 BioHackathon](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/),
    attracting more than 30 developers. The participants also collaborated with the _Workflows_ and _FAIR Data_ topics.


    Thanks to the collaborative effort WorkflowHub could be launched early at <https://covid19.workflowhub.eu/> in a "pre-beta" stage. The COVID-19 workflows registered at the hackathon now appear as part of <https://workflowhub.eu/>
