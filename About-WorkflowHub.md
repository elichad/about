# About WorkflowHub

Created as part of the [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/) WP2 [Tools Collaboratory](https://github.com/eosc-life/tools-collaboratory-roadmap), the WorkflowHub is under development.

See a complete list on the [acknowledgement](acknowledgements) page.

Aims of the project include:

* Evolvement of [myExperiment](https://myexperiment.org/) that is workflow system agnostic, supports a repository of workflows in native and standardised form (e.g. [CWL](https://commonwl.org/) and the virtual aggregation of established tool, workflow and registries to support discovery over a fragmented ecosystem. The federated registry would support a **common API** to simplify access for tool developers.
* Standardised workflow identifiers and metadata descriptions needed for workflow discovery, reuse, preservation, interoperability and monitoring and metadata harvesting using standard protocols. Workflows are usually multi-component (requiring links to test data, example runs, explanatory documentation, etc) and used in collections for scientific use cases. We plan to use the Research Object specification for packaging workflows, which has already been combined with [CWL](https://commonwl.org/) and is part of the [BioComputeObject](http://biocomputeobject.org/) specification.
* Workflow snapshot preservation, publishing, citation and monitoring, credit claiming and workflows part of the scholarly communication landscape partnering with platforms like [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) and EOSCâ€™s [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) and their Research Community Dashboards linking publications with workflows, associated datasets, software, etc.
* The workflow registry is planned to be based on the [SEEK platform](https://seek4science.org/) using [Common Workflow Language](https://commonwl.org/) and [Research Objects](http://www.researchobject.org/) to glue in federated workflow and tool descriptions across the research infrastructures.
