# TRS API

WorkflowHub implements GA4GH's [Tool Registry Service API](https://www.ga4gh.org/news/tool-registry-service-api-enabling-an-interoperable-library-of-genomics-analysis-tools/) to facilitate discovery of workflows in an interoperable way.

The root of the API is at `https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/` So, for example, tools can be found at: [https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools](https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools)

Documentation on how to use the TRS API can be found here: [https://ga4gh.github.io/tool-registry-service-schemas/swagger-ui/?url=../preview/develop/docs/web_deploy/swagger.json](https://ga4gh.github.io/tool-registry-service-schemas/swagger-ui/?url=../preview/develop/docs/web_deploy/swagger.json).

Details of the current implementation, such as the version of the specification implemented, and associated documentation can be found here: [https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/service-info](https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/service-info)
