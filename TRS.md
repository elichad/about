# TRS API

WorkflowHub implements GA4GH's [Tool Registry Service API](https://www.ga4gh.org/news/tool-registry-service-api-enabling-an-interoperable-library-of-genomics-analysis-tools/) API to facilitate discovery of workflows in an interoperable way.

The root of the API is at `https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/`, i.e. tools can be found at: [https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools](https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools)

Details of the current implementation, such as the spec version and docs can be found here: [https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/service-info](https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/service-info)
