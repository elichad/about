title: Supported workflow types 
---

Following workflow types are tested to work well with WorkflowHub:

* [Galaxy (.ga)](glossary.md/#galaxy)
* [Common Workflow Language (.cwl)](glossary.md/#cwl)
* [Nextflow (.nf)](glossary.md#nextflow)
* [SnakeMake (.snake)](glossary.md#snakemake)
* [KNIME (.knwf)](glossary.md#knime)

It is also possible to upload workflows from any another type (e.g. bash scripts), either as `Other` or by proposing a new type.

Note that it is only possible to automatically generate a diagram for CWL workflows.
