title: Supported workflow types 
---

Following workflow types are tested to work well with WorkflowHub:

* Galaxy (.ga)
* Common Workflow Language (.cwl)
* Nextflow (.nf)
* SnakeMake (.snake)
* KNIME (.knwf)

It is also possible to upload workflows from any another type (e.g. bash scripts), either as `Other` or by proposing a new type.

Note that it is only possible to automatically generate a diagram for CWL workflows.
