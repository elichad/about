## What is the overall process for registration?

Using the WorkflowHub registration wizard:

1. Import a workflow file. These can be:
   1. A local file, or files
   2. A remote file URL
   3. A git repository
   4. A zipped Research Object Crate (RO-crate)
2. Register the workflow
3. Add relevant metadata
4. Review the entry and finalise registration
