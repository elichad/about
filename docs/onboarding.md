title: How to get started with WorkflowHub
---

WorkflowHub will help make your workflows findable and citable, and this guide will help you get started with that process.

## 1. [Register yourself on WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/signup)

{% include callout.html type="note" content="you can also log in using your GitHub credentials." %}

## 2. Decide which `space` you would like to create a `team` in

**Figure 1** below highlights the basic structure of WorkflowHub, and examples of the three types of `spaces` where you could create a `team`.

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="see this link to learn more about [teams and spaces?](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/what-is-a-team/)." %}

You can create a `team` in any or all of the following `spaces`:

- [**Independent teams**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/3): this is where you can create a team if you do not require a specific space
- [**A pre-existing space**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes), for example:
     * [**Australian BioCommons**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/8)
     * [**BioExcel**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/2)
     * [**EOSC-Life**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/6)
- [**A new space**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/new): if a pre-existing space is not suitable, you can create a space
     * This is a good option if you represent a group, consortium, or community where multiple teams might want to register with WorkflowHub

{% include callout.html type="note" content="you can create multiple teams in multiple spaces, depending on your requirements." %}

WorkflowHub: spaces, teams and workflows. Right - examples of
where you can create your new team on WorkflowHub.]({{ '/images/spaces.svg' | relative_url }})

## 3. [Create a team](https://workflowhub.eu/projects/guided_create) or [join an existing team](https://workflowhub.eu/projects/guided_join)

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="see this link to find out [how to create and join teams and spaces](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/joining-a-team/)." %}

{% include callout.html type="important" content="if you are creating a team, make sure the team name is descriptive." %}

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="if you want to test WorkflowHub and its features, 
there is a [development instance available here](https://dev.workflowhub.eu/)." %}

**Figure 2** shows the minimum information required for a new team, which includes:

- **Space** - the space you selected or created in step 2 above
- **Team name**
- **Team organization** - the organization that should be linked to your team on WorkflowHub. e.g. [University of Melbourne]()
     * If your organization is not yet on WorkflowHub, you can [create an organization](https://workflowhub.eu/institutions/new)

{% include callout.html type="important" content="you can add multiple organizations to both your profile and teams on WorkflowHub." %}

to be entered into the Create a New Team wizard on WorkflowHub.]({{ '/images/team.svg' | relative_url }})

## 4. Register workflow(s) using the [WorkflowHub wizard](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/new)

There is an extensive guide to the [workflow registration process](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/registering-a-workflow/) 
available in the WorkflowHub documentation.
