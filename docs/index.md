## Before you start


## Quick start guide


**Tip**: We recommend importing a git repository (e.g. GitHub), since WorkflowHub is a hub / registry and not a repository.

1. [Login](https://workflowhub.eu/login) to WorkflowHub
2. Select `Contribute` on the main page
3. Select the `Import Git repository` option
4. Add your Git repository URL and click `Register`
5. Complete the required metadata ([title](#bookmark=id.a6zyg9lmmmww), [projects/teams](#bookmark=id.peoddok35g18) and [creators](#bookmark=id.b2darvuxqrlk))
6. Click `Register`
7. Review the final workflow entry and edit as needed

> **Did you know?**
> You can also register your workflow using a Research Object Crate (RO-Crate). This is an option for advanced users, and  further instructions can be found here. The advanced way: registering a workflow RO-crate When you have created a workflow RO-Crate of your workflow  using the python package, and want to upload or reference it.

> **In development**
_Registering a workflow RO-Crate using the API_
> We are working on a WorkflowHub API that will allow the user 
> to automatically register workflow RO-Crates. Not all features are 
> yet developed, but a glimpse of the API can be found here.
