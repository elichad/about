title: A guide to organising your workflows on WorkflowHub
---

The documentation below provides guidance on the relationship between a given workflow and the structural elements of the WorkflowHub registry: `Spaces`, `Teams` and `Collections`. 
We also provide examples of how to structure larger consortia and projects on WorkflowHub that accommodates recognition of multiple `Organisations` and `Teams`, potentially across multiple `Spaces`.

[More information on Spaces, Teams and Organisations](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/joining-a-team/).

## Can a workflow exist in multiple `Teams`?

Answer: Yes

Detail: A workflow must be associated with at least one `Team`. If no `Space` is required, then a `Team` can be created in the [Independent Teams space](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/3) to fulfil this requirement.

## Can a single workflow exist within multiple `Spaces`?

Answer: Yes, by being in multiple `Teams` and those `Teams` may be in different `Spaces`.

Detail: A workflow can NOT be associated directly with a `Space`. `Teams` can, and in this way two teams from two different `Spaces` can be associated with a single workflow.

## Can a workflow exist in multiple `Collections`?

Answer: Yes.

Detail: A workflow can be added to many collections. For example, please see the [`HiFi genome assembly on Galaxy`](https://workflowhub.eu/collections/5) and [`BioCommons ‘Bring Your Own Data’ Expansion Project`](https://workflowhub.eu/collections/6) collections, which both contain the same HiFi genome assembly workflows (e.g. [PacBio HiFi genome assembly using hifiasm v2.1](https://doi.org/10.48546/WORKFLOWHUB.WORKFLOW.221.3)).

## How do I add a workflow from one Team into another Team?

Answer: You need to add the additional `Team(s)` to the workflow metadata. To do this, select `Manage Workflow` from the `Actions` drop down menu. In the `Manage Workflow` section that appears, select a team that you would like to add and then click the `Update` button at the bottom of the screen.

## Can I migrate / move a workflow from one Team to another Team?

Answer: Yes.

Detail: To do this, follow the instructions above for adding a new `Team` to your workflow. To remove a `Team`, click the red cross next to the `Team` name. To save changes, click the `Update` button at the bottom of the screen.
