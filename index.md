<summary>BCC2020 CollaborationFest (2020-07-22 / 2020-07-23)</summary>

Workflow Hub was one of the working clusters at the [BCC2020 CollaborationFest](https://bcc2020.github.io/cofest/) as part of [Bioinformatics Community Conference 2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/).

Activities included a _Bring your own Workflow_ session to register more workflows at <https://workflowhub.eu/>.

_Improving support for Galaxy workflows_ worked closely with Galaxy developers at BCC and the topic _Exporting RO-Crate/BioCompute-Object packaged workflows from Galaxy_ which made a first release of the [RO-Crate Python library](https://pypi.org/project/rocrate/) and alignments with [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/).

_Metadata and BioSchemas_ aligned and released [BioSchemas ComputationalWorkflow profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/0.5-DRAFT-2020_07_21/) 0.5 which was also aligned with the next version of [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/).

_IWC for Galaxy Workflows_ looked at API for workflow registration and created an open source license drop-down list for workflows.

<summary>COVID-19 BioHackathon (2020-04-05 / 2020-04-11)</summary>

Workflow Hub was one of the topics at the [Virtual COVID-19 BioHackathon](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/), attracting more than 30 developers. The participants also collaborated with the _Workflows_ and _FAIR Data_ topics.

Thanks to the collaborative effort the Workflow Hub could be launched early at <https://covid19.workflowhub.eu/> in a "pre-beta" stage. The COVID-19 workflows registered at the hackathon now appear as part of <https://workflowhub.eu/>
