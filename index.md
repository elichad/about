[WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is a new FAIR **workflow registry** sponsored by the European RI Cluster EOSC-Life and the European Research Infrastructure ELIXIR. It is workflow management system agnostic: workflows may remain in their native repositories in their native forms.

This website describes the open source **project** for developing and running [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/).

For more details, see [About WorkflowHub](/project), [FAIR Computational Workflows](https://workflows.community/groups/fair/), [Outreach and Publications](/project/outreach).
