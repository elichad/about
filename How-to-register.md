# How to register

> Which WorkflowHub instance?
> * Use <https://dev.workflowhub.eu/> for testing - this testing instance may occasionally be wiped
> * (TODO) Use <http://covid19.workflowhub.eu/> for long-lived workflow registrations - this will become the production instance

If your project is already in WorkflowHub please select it from the dropdown menu. If your institute is already in WorkflowHub please select it from the dropdown menu.
